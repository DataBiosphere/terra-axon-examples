# Single Cell research on Verily Workbench

**Work in progess**

The example notebook here can help you get started with research on single cell data.
A notebook is provided showing how to access public single cell data.

## Data

The notebook in this directory demonstrates access to data from the [Human Cell Atlas (HCA)](https://www.humancellatlas.org/). The HCA mission is "to create comprehensive reference maps of all human cells—the fundamental units of life—as a basis for both understanding human health and diagnosing, monitoring, and treating disease."

Code provided here is for demonstration purposes. If you use HCA data for research, consider joining the [HCA Membership](https://www.humancellatlas.org/register/). For more information on the use of HCA data, please see the [Data Release Policy](https://www.humancellatlas.org/data-release-policy/).

### Organization

HCA data is organized into "Projects" which can be discovered through the Catalog. You can interactively [browse the Catalog](https://data.humancellatlas.org/explore/projects) or access it via the public [Data Browser API](https://data.humancellatlas.org/apis/api-documentation/data-browser-api).
