    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended to demonstrate how you can use the Nextflow engine on Terra to execute and manage workflows. By running the cells in this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "* Configure Nextflow to run on this cloud environment\n",
    "* Run Nextflow workflows on actual datasets\n",
    "* Check the status of submitted jobs\n",
    "* Leverage the Google Cloud Life Sciences API to execute workflow tasks in parallel\n",
    "* View the logs for each step of the workflows executed\n",
    "* Clean up intermediate results to reduce cloud storage use\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all of the commands demonstrated with the prefix `!` are shell commands, which you can also run from a command-line such as a Jupyter terminal."
