(To instead create a cluster using the Workbench web UI, see [this guide](https://support.workbench.verily.com/docs/how_to_guides/dataproc/)).\n",

    "This notebook is most straightforward to run from a Workbench workspace [notebook cloud environment](https://support.workbench.verily.com/docs/how_to_guides/using_cloud_environments/), which will pre-install the Workbench CLI.  You can use the default settings when you create the notebook environment. \n",
