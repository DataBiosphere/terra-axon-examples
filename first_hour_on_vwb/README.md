# First Hour on Verily Workbench

## Overview

This workspace is designed to jumpstart new users' onboarding to Verily Workbench by demonstrating some of the core capabilities of the platform in a series of JupyterLab notebooks.
New users who engage with this workspace will be exposed to a variety of helpful references and many examples of foundational utilities and best practices that they can then build upon for their specific use cases.

## Getting started

- Run the [working_with_groups.ipynb](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/terra-axon-examples/blob/main/first_hour_on_vwb/working_with_groups.ipynb) notebook to learn about creating and deleting [Workbench groups](https://terra-docs.api.verily.com/docs/reference/glossary/#group) and managing Workbench group membership.

- Run the [working_with_data_collections.ipynb](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/terra-axon-examples/blob/main/first_hour_on_vwb/working_with_data_collections.ipynb) notebook to learn about creating Workbench [data collections](https://terra-docs.api.verily.com/docs/reference/glossary/#data-collection) and adding them to your workspaces via the Workbench [data catalog](https://terra-docs.api.verily.com/docs/reference/glossary/#data-catalog).
