# First Hour on Terra

## Overview

The notebooks in this directory show how to perform a number of tasks using Terra. They are intended to give a new Terra user an overview of helpful references and best practices that can be built upon.

## Getting started

Run the [working_with_data_collections.ipynb](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/terra-axon-examples/blob/main/first_hour_on_terra/working_with_data_collections.ipynb) notebook to learn about creating data collections and adding them to your workspaces.
