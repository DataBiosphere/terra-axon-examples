# First Hour on Verily Workbench

## Overview

This workspace is designed to jumpstart new users' onboarding to Verily Workbench by demonstrating some of the core capabilities of the platform in a series of JupyterLab notebooks.
New users who engage with this workspace will be exposed to a variety of helpful references and many examples of foundational utilities and best practices that they can then build upon for their specific use cases.
