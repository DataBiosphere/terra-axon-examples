    "The purpose of this example is to calculate the number of participants with a diagnosis of skin condition based on a list of ICD-10 codes.\n",
    "As a starting point for this study, we define the diagnosis of skin condition as a condition coded with an ICD-10 code from the following list:\n",
    "- `L70.*`: Acne\n",
    "- `L20.*`: Atopic dermatitis\n",
    "- `L40.*`: Psoriasis\n",
    "- `L80.*`: Vitiligo\n",
    "\n",
    "where \"\\*\" corresponds to any sequence of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, it is necessary to perform the following steps:\n",
    "1. **Converting the ICD-10 codes of skin condition to concept IDs**:\n",
    "This step consists of finding the concept IDs associated with the ICD-10 codes in the following list: `L70`, `L20`, `L40` and `L80`. To do this, we will use the `concept` table of the OMOP vocabulary and find all `concept_code` equal to one of the ICD-10 codes for the `vocabulary_id` equal to \"ICD10CM\". See the CTE `skin_condition_ICD_concept_ids` in the SQL query below.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Find the standard concept IDs linked to the ICD-10 concept IDs**:\n",
    "The majority of conditions are coded with a standard concept ID (corresponding to a SNOMED code). Therefore, we need to find the standard concept IDs corresponding to the concept IDs previously extracted in step 1. The CTE `standard_concept_ids` in the SQL query below consists of retrieving only the standard concept IDs from the `concept` table (i.e., `standard_concept` equal to \"S\") and the CTE `skin_condition_standard_concept_ids` consists of mapping the concept IDs from step 1 to the standard concept IDs (i.e., using the `concept_relationship` table with `relationship_id` equal to \"Maps to\").\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find all concept IDs linked to the standard skin condition concept IDs**:\n",
    "The dataset may also contain non-standard concept IDs. To ensure that we include patients who have a diagnosis of skin condition using a non-standard concept ID, we need to find all concept IDs associated with the core set of standard concept IDs identified in the previous step. To do this, we again use the `concept_relationship` table, setting our standard concept IDs as concept_id_2 when using the `relationship_id` of \"Maps to\". We union these with our standard concept IDs to get a full set of skin condition concept_ids. See the CTEs `skin_condition_nonstandard_concept_ids` and `skin_condition_all_concept_ids` in the SQL query below.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Find all the descendants of the skin condition concept IDs**:\n",
    "The condition concept IDs are organized under an ontology with different levels of precision. Therefore, to capture all concept IDs for skin condition, we must also find all descendants of the concept IDs previously extracted in step 3. To do this, we will use the `concept_ancestor` table with the `ancestor_concept_id` equal to the concept IDs from step 3 and extract all `descendant_concept_id` as the final list `all_concept_ids_with_descendants` in the SQL query below.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Calculate the number of participants with a diagnosis of skin condition**:\n",
    "Finally, the last step is to extract and count the participants with at least one diagnosis of skin condition. We will use the `condition_occurrence` table and filter only the conditions coded with a `condition_concept_id` corresponding to a concept ID of the previously extracted list. See the CTE `nb_of_participants_diagnosed_with_skin_condition` in the SQL query below.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Calculate the percentage of participants with a diagnosis of skin condition**:\n",
    "Finally, the last step is to calculate the percentage with at least one diagnosis of skin condition out of the total number of participants. We will use the number of participants in the `person` table and calculate the percentage. See the CTE `nb_total_of_participants` in the SQL query below."
