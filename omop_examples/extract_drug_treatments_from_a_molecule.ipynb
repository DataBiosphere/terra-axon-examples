    "The purpose of this example is to calculate the number of participants who were treated with drugs containing\n",

    "1. **Converting the RxCUI code of Quinapril molecule to concept ID**:\n",
    "This step consists of finding the concept ID associated with the `35208` RxCUI code. To do this, we will use the `concept` table of the OMOP vocabulary and the `concept_code` equal to the RxCUI code for the `vocabulary_id` equal to \"RxNorm\". See the CTE `quinapril_RxNorm_concept_id` in the SQL query below.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Find the drug standard concept IDs**:\n",
    "Drugs are coded with a standard concept ID (corresponding to a RxNorm code). Therefore, We need to find the concept IDs linked to drugs containing the Quinapril molecule. The CTE `medications_with_quinapril` in the SQL query below consists of extracting all the descendants of the ingredient concept ID from step 1, which are all the drugs containing the Metropol ingredient.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find all drug concept IDs**:\n",
    "Because some of the drugs may be coded using non-standard concept IDs, we recommend mapping the standard concept IDs identified in step 2 to obtain a comprehensive set of relevant concept IDs. This mapping is performed using the concept_relationship table of the OMOP vocabulary, where concept_id_2 is the standard concept ID(s) identified in step 1, and the relationship_id is 'Maps to'. See the CTE `all_medications_with_quinapril` in the SQL query below.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the number of participants who were treated with Quinapril**:\n",
    "The next step is to extract and count the participants with at least one Quinapril drug exposure. We will use the `drug_exposure` table and filter only the drugs coded with a `drug_concept_id` corresponding to a concept ID of the previously extracted list. See the CTE `nb_of_participants_treated_with_quinapril` in the SQL query below.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Calculate the percentage of participants who were treated with Quinapril**:\n",
    "Finally, the last step is to calculate the percentage who were treated with Quinapril out of the total number of participants. We will use the number of participants in the `person` table and calculate the percentage. See the CTE `nb_total_of_participants` in the SQL query below."
