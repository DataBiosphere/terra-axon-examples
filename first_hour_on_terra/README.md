# First Hour on Terra

## Overview

The notebooks in this directory show how to perform a number of tasks using Terra. They are intended to give a new Terra user an overview of helpful references and best practices that can be built upon.

## Getting started

Run the [workspace_resource_examples.ipynb](https://github.com/todo) notebook to learn about best practices for adding, removing, and sharing workspace resources on Terra.
